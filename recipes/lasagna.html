    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish that typically consists of layered sheets of wide flat pasta, a tomato-based sauce, and various other ingredients such as ground meat, cheese, and vegetables. The layers are typically topped with a b√©chamel sauce and baked in the oven until the cheese on top is melted and bubbly.
